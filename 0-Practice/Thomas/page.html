          <p class="text-props"><span>My passion for art and design started at a young age which I got from drawing with my grandfather.</span></p>
          <p class="text-props"><span>As soon as I was able, I went to a school where I could learn to become better at art and design.
This school was SintLucas.</span></p>
          <p class="text-props"><span>While studying I had to find an internship and wanted to challenge myself and at the same time gain more experience and see different cultures. Because of this I decided to go to Bangkok, Thailand for my internship, where I worked at a game company for 5 months.</span></p>
