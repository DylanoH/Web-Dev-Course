          <p class="text-props"><span>My passion for art and design started at a young age which I got<br />from drawing with my grandfather.</span></p>
          <p class="text-props"><span>As soon as I was able, I went to a school where I could learn to<br /> become better at art and design.
<br />This school was SintLucas.</span></p>
          <p class="text-props"><span>While studying I had to find an internship and wanted to challenge<br /> myself and at the same time gain more experience and see
            different cultures. Because of this I decided to go to Bangkok, Thailand for my internship, where I worked at a game company for 5 months.</span></p>
